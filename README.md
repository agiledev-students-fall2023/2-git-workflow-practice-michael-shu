MGM Resorts, along with its property MGM Springfield, is currently grappling with a cybersecurity attack, leaving its employees in a state of distress. Alvin Evans III, who is in the process of training to join the security team at the T-Mobile Arena, a co-owned venue by MGM Resorts International, was among those affected. The news of the cyber attack disrupted the web service used for scheduling and payroll, preventing employees like Evans from accessing critical information. Frustration is mounting as paychecks have been delayed, causing financial concerns for workers who rely on their wages to cover bills and expenses. MGM Resorts initially assured employees that their payments would proceed as scheduled, but as of Saturday, many like Evans had yet to receive their paychecks. The situation has prompted numerous unanswered inquiries to HR, adding to employees' anxiety about their financial stability. The delay is attributed to manual entry of times, with an estimated 24 to 48 hours for resolution, leaving employees uncertain about when they will receive the money they depend on. Despite reaching out to MGM Resorts for comment, no response has been received regarding the late paycheck complaints. This cybersecurity attack not only threatens the company's operations but also puts its dedicated workforce in a precarious position.
